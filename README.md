Download podcasts in bulk!

The reason why I created "bulkpod-dl" is because one of my favorite podcasts just released their last episode and I wanted to archive the show in case it gets removed from the host(s) in the future.
However, no websites allowed me to download all of the episodes at once. Thankfully we can automate this instead of clicking "download" on each and every episode, it's a real drag if there are hundreds of episodes.

## How-to

- Run the script
- Choose "1" in the menu and enter the RSS feed of your desired show
- The script will check the RSS feed and if it's OK you will see output information of your show before you are sent back to the main menu again
- Now, choose "2" in the menu to download all episodes listed in the shows RSS feed
- Do something else while all the episodes are being downloaded :bowtie:

## Good to know

In case you don't have time to download all of the episodes you can always abort the download by using the trusty "CTRL+C" command.
The script will automatically resume where you left off.   

NOTE!   
I'd advice you to manually delete the episode you were downloading when you aborted the process. The script recognizes already downloaded episodes by name, not by size or length.
